          <p class="whypara">
            New Zealand is famous for being a small country -its population has only recently broken the four million mark. 
            New Zealand has no class system. People from all walks oflife end up here. People from all over the world come 
            here as it is one of the best countries to live and it is also among the safest countries in the world. Local people 
            are considered to be very friendly and helpful so good people around us make our lifeeasier over there. 
            It is nice to live in a place where tribal culture and the values that go with it are still in evidence. 
            The presence of Maori names, art, customs and tourist experiences make New Zealand unique in the world, 
            not just another European/Americanised western country. Of course, New Zealand is a Europeanised country, 
            but it has so many influences from so many places around the world, especially Asian countries, that it's a 
            complete melting pot.

  <h2 class="eduheading">Education in New Zealand</h2>
  <p class="edupara">New Zealand has simple and centrally managed education system. New Zealand's educational institutions offer 
      quality secondary school education, a well-established network of English-language schools, and internationally respected 
      and recognized tertiary education providers. The New Zealand Qualifications Authority (NZQA) regulates post-secondary education. 
      As well as state-owned education providers, there are approximately 860 private training establishments (PTEs) in New Zealand. 
      They are privately owned and funded, although some of their courses attract government funding and they include quality 
      English-language providers. They offer a wide variety of courses that lead to qualifications in a large range of vocations 
      from scuba diving to hospitality to business. NZQA requires that Private Training Establishments (PTEs) have adequate protection 
      of student fees and tuition. Polytechnics offer education and training at tertiary levels ranging from introductory studies through 
      to full degree programs. They deliver technical, vocational, and professional education. There are 23 polytechnics or institutes of 
      technology in New Zealand. The National Qualifications Framework is a system of national qualifications available through study 
      in schools, polytechnics, colleges of education, etc. The Framework provides nationally recognized, consistent standards and 
      qualifications. The Framework is endorsed and supported by New Zealand's education and training providers, employers and national 
      industry and professional groups. It is compatible with similar systems in the U.K., Europe, South Africa, Australia, and North America. 
      There are 10 levels of study in New Zealand schools and universities. The lowest level is a certificate and the highest is a doctoral degree.
